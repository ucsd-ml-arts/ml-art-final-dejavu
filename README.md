## Abstract Proposal

There are countless black&white manga available. However, few of them are colorized as it spends much additional time for comic book creators to paint from the black&white version. What if we have an auto painter that convert b&w manga into colorized ones? In project 4, a manga colorization solution was developed based on pix2pix model. It was able to colorize b&w manga pages based on some colorized samples. However the synthetic color was sometimes unnature. For final project, we will try to refine the results and make them more natural. Also, we will try some style transfer during colorization. Colored image genearted from model will be presented in the final presentation.

## Project Report

Upload your project report (4 pages) as a pdf with your repository, following this template: [google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/133H59WZBmH6MlAgFSskFLMQITeIC5d9b2iuzsOfa4E8/edit?usp=sharing).

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data)

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- What you include here will very much depend on the format of your final project
  - image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
  - 3d models
  - movie files (uploaded to youtube or vimeo due to github file size limits)
  - audio files
  - ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
